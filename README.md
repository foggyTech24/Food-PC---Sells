Food PC project build

I have been researching and planning to build an indoor environmentally controlled aquaponics grow system in my garage, I intend to evantually develop a business in the industry. After seeing the MIT Personal Food Computer I decided to build the project and use it as a research springboard for futher developing my own project. I will simply be attempting to build the computer as it is described in the open sourced github.
